# Advent of Code
My repository of solutions for every edition of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge!

## Disclaimers
- I'll usually publish my solutions around a day after the problem got published, given that in the first 24h 
there may be competitions active about who solves a problem first.

- My solutions are not perfect, neither pretty: I want to use this as a training for the Italian Problem Solving 
olympics, so it's far more important to write an algorithm that works on the fly instead of spending time researching the prettiest way to do it.

- I don't guarantee my scripts work "as-is": I usually do hacky stuff just to complete a problem faster, such as using 
hardcoded values instead of the provided inputs. This is mainly for archival purposes, so take all provided code with a 
grain of salt :)
